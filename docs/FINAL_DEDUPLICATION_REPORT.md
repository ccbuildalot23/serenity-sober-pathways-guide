# Final Deduplication Report

The deduplication review consolidated duplicate services, hooks, and components across the application. The legacy realtime service and audit loggers were removed in favor of their enhanced counterparts, and repeated utilities were merged into unified modules.

## Summary of Changes
- **48 files modified** with a net reduction of **over 1,700 lines** of code
- Consolidated input validation, audit logging, and realtime services
- Removed deprecated CBT skills library, crisis system, calendar page, and other outdated components
- Centralized exports added under `src/components/index.ts` and `src/utils/index.ts`
- Simplified ESLint configuration and lint workflow
- Added `vercel.json` for streamlined deployments

The repository now relies solely on the enhanced implementations, improving maintainability and reducing technical debt.
