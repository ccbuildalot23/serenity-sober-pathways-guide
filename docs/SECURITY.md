# Security Documentation

## Overview
This application implements comprehensive security measures to protect user data and ensure secure operation. This document outlines our security practices and guidelines for development and deployment.

## Authentication Security

### Supabase Configuration
- Uses environment variables for credentials (never hardcoded)
- Implements PKCE flow for enhanced OAuth security
- Automatic token refresh and secure session management
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies on all database tables

### Session Management
- 30-minute session timeout with activity monitoring
- Device fingerprinting for session validation
- Automatic session extension warnings
- Secure session cleanup on timeout or logout

## Data Protection

### Encryption
- Server-side encryption for sensitive data using Supabase Edge Functions
- Client-side data is never encrypted (security by design)
- Audit logs use server-side encryption
- Crisis data encrypted before storage

### Database Security
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- User data isolation through RLS policies
- Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Input validation and sanitization

## Client-Side Security

### Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Strict CSP with nonce-based inline scripts/styles
- No unsafe-eval or unsafe-inline allowed
- Trusted sources only for external resources
- Frame protection and XSS prevention

### Input Validation
- Comprehensive input sanitization
- XSS prevention through HTML encoding
- SQL injection prevention
- File upload restrictions and validation

### Security Headers
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- Enhanced Permissions-Policy restrictions

## Monitoring and Audit

### Security Monitoring
- Failed login attempt tracking and rate limiting
- Suspicious activity pattern detection
- Development tools access monitoring (production only)
- Real-time security event logging

### Audit Logging
- Comprehensive audit trail for all user actions
- Server-side encrypted audit logs
- Security violation tracking
- Authentication event logging

## Crisis Data Security

### Emergency Data Protection
- End-to-end encryption for crisis plans
- Offline data encryption for emergency access
- Secure emergency contact handling
- Crisis intervention audit logging

### Privacy Protection
- User data anonymization where possible
- Minimal data retention policies
- Secure data deletion procedures
- Privacy-by-design implementation

## Development Security Guidelines

### Environment Management
- Use .env.example for environment variable documentation
- Never commit sensitive keys to version control
- Use Supabase secrets for server-side configuration
- Validate environment variables at runtime

### Code Security
- Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning
- No hardcoded secrets or sensitive data
- Secure error handling without information leakage
- Input validation at all application layers

### API Security
- Rate limiting on all API endpoints
- Authentication required for sensitive operations
- CORS properly configured
- Request/response validation

## Deployment Security

### Production Checklist
1. ✅ Environment variables properly configured
2. ✅ Supabase RLS policies enabled and tested
3. ✅ Security headers applied
4. ✅ HTTPS enforced
5. ✅ Auth redirect URLs configured
6. ✅ Rate limiting enabled
7. ✅ Monitoring and alerting configured
8. ✅ Backup and recovery procedures tested

### Security Testing
- Regular penetration testing
- Automated security scanning
- Manual security reviews
- User acceptance testing for security features

## Incident Response

### Security Incidents
1. Immediate containment and assessment
2. User notification if data is affected
3. Root cause analysis and remediation
4. Post-incident review and improvements

### Breach Response
- Immediate system isolation if necessary
- User credential reset if compromised
- Audit log analysis for impact assessment
- Regulatory notification if required

## Compliance and Standards

### Data Protection
- GDPR compliance for EU users
- CCPA compliance for California users
- Healthcare data protection (where applicable)
- Regular compliance audits

### Security Standards
- OWASP Top 10 mitigation
- Secure coding practices
- Regular security training for developers
- Third-party security assessments

## Contact and Reporting

### Security Issues
Report security vulnerabilities or concerns immediately to the development team.

### Regular Reviews
- Monthly security review meetings
- Quarterly penetration testing
- Annual comprehensive security audit
- Continuous monitoring and improvement
